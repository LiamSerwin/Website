        <p>I’m wasting away, only slightly. This phone is a curse. The one thing I forgot to bring home was the one thing I need. I wish I didn’t know where my dad put his weed. Today once again as with everyday I am static in the possibility. I need a therapist to unlock this I think. I also do not know who I am. I need time with myself, real god damn time with myself. No screens. No one around. I wish I had done that </p>

<p> Ok i forgot about how good it is to just be nice to yourself. It is abysmal to have to attach 
‘I am proud of you for doing x’ after literally everything that I do. I am proud of you for picking up that sock. I am proud of you for getting out of bed.  I am proud of you for turning on the shower. Very fascinated by what it means for me to be proud of me, or for I to be proud of you. Told Alice that I would continue

<p> “we consume an endless stream of space without time” adam on what doom scrolling does to us. I am getting sleepy. I should eat something, I think. The ritalin today has worked exactly as I’ve wanted it to. Given me just enough focus space so that I an really engage in the different things i’ve wanted to today. I find myself burning out slightly, but i think this is because i am smashing so much into my brain all at once. But i needed that, a day where i trudge past the resistance, get into the habit and practice of reading and writing until my brain doesn’t feel like it could do anything else. This might be my biggest problem to date. I spend so much of my time thinking about the things I want to do, and very little actually doing anything. I think some buddhists sentiment could help me here, but i do think that on some level, the thing  i want to do in the world that we currently live in requires me to have some sort of structure. I like writing things down without looking. Its a cool skill to have in the first [lace, something to brag about oat parties adn resumes, but there is also something i feel gained in not looking at the screen. This brings me back to the thing earlier about the space difference between the written word and typed one.this is a third thing. Where it feels that the true streamline of my consciousness is being coded into my words, rather than the eyes' influence. There is something there, something intriguing to perhaps think about more, what words are in different contexts. </p>  

<p>What does it matter that this is our main referential point? Imagine a boy. A boy who grows up watching movies about how he will fall in love with a girl, and from then on, he would be happy. He spends his early years looking for love, as was shown to him in those very movies that told who he needed to be. At some point he finds someone. He’s jubilant, delusional off the love he now knows he has. But then
Nothing. He feels nothing. The prophet told him what he should do, how he should do it, and yet, still having completed all of those tasks, it does not feel right. He breaks it off. Devotes himself to preserving the idealized version of this love into a story, a film, a film that will perfectly encapsulate that feeling that he knows is out there, how could it not be? It was the only thing he knew. Now his movie comes out. It's successful, archetypal. They say he's a genius, encapsulating that which no one else before had ever been able to achieve, to communicate that message which has failed to be answered. The novel before him, the painting before her, and what before that? The oral story, the cave etching? We have always perceived the world through reference points, what is so debilitating about our current one?

      <p> At the beach. Having to remember that I like the sun. Ughhhh I hate that feeling. That resistance that comes with any words I put on the page guhhh there it is, so abrasive, coarse, and painful. And even those words don’t in any way compare to the sensation. I am at the beach. Donovan gave me his Dodgers hat since I forgot most everything one should bring to the beach: a hat, water…really I think it was just those two. We all reapply sunscreen every few minutes. The rest of the group will get here sometime in the next hour, and we will want to leave. Caught a glimpse of myself in the reflection of the phone. I hate having those little prickly reminders jut out every 12 hours. 

Tiktok is a fear mongering state. I could see myself making a series,, where I go through tiktok by slowly forcing my algorithm nicher and nicher into an insane topic. Yup yea that sounds good. I do not know how to be away from the pulse. It’s so infectious. The surge in chemical feeling. The peripheral connection. Just knowing you are a part of something more finite than yourself. I was telling Donny something about this on the way back from Hermosa Beach. </p>
 <p>“Mark Fisher had this thing he wrote about.” </p>
 <p>Donny nodded his head, “Mark Fisher.”</p>
 <p>“––What was that?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Keep going.”</p>
<p>“It was about one of his students. How they were playing music into some old wire headphones without evening listening. The kid said something about how he didn’t want to not be connected, and how that’s really the different webs of media that make us feel like we always have to be involved––and even worse, that we like it.”</p>
 <p> You ever see the drummer from Rush?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. My dad showed me the dudes drumkit when I was kid.</p>
<p>“So cool.”</p>
<p>“So cool.”</p> 

<p>back of my knees ended up sunburnt. It feels nice. A little noticeable. We did end up leaving the beach right when they showed up. But we got some great poke. So net win to me. Deciding that I should stay in tomorrow. I haven’t really given myself the opportunity of solitude since I got back from Oregon. Longer if I’m being honest, which is something I'm trying more now. I could write whole love letters to words, but they wouldn’t quite capture it. There is no logical sequence of words that would be able to describe it, I think. I could get close. I could spend my whole life trying different combinations of words like fluid or fluttering or convulsing or matte or even make up a word like polylucient or </p>
